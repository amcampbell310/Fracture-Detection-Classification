# Fracture-Detection-Classification
Machine Learning models trained on x-ray images for fracture detection and classification

Developed as an independent research/study project to look into cost effective methods of AI usage in radiology and orthopedic medical fields, that enhances their work without job displacement.

A full statisical analysis of the models was used to determine their viability and feasibility in the industry.
